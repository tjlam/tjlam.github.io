                   The Science of permanent hair reduction by using light energy has been around for well over 50 years, and the first laser device used to remove hair was approved by the FDA in 1997.  Getting rid of excess hair is not only for cosmetic reasons, often it improves personal hygiene, reduces odour and bacteria on the skin, improves skin texture, prevent infections and ingrown hairs and other health benefits. <br><br>
                   At MD Laser Skin Clinic, we have been successfully performing this procedure for over 10 years, and all of our technicians are highly experienced.  Laser hair removal is highly popular and is the mainstay of our clinic.  However, due to the science of light therapy, not everyone is a good candidate based on differences in skin and hair colour, hormonal influences, etc, therefore, a consultation is required to assess your skin. <br><br> 
                   Our fees are competitive but not ridiculously low because we pride ourselves on our expertise and giving excellent service to our clients.   Call us for an evaluation!

                <h3>How it works</h3>
                <p>
                   Laser hair removal is a process that safely eliminates unwanted body hair by using various wavelengths of light that is selectively absorbed by the dark pigment in hair follicles.  The latest technology uses Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) to deliver light energy into the follicle which is transformed into heat that destroys the hair bulb, leaving the surrounding skin unharmed. <br><br>
                   During the procedure, most people feel only a slight momentary “snap” (like a rubber band) on their skin that is in contact with  the laser handpiece.  Cooling of the skin is done through the laser device and also with application of ice packs and cool rollers, making the procedure very tolerable, without the use of topical anaesthetic creams.  Most treatments take only minutes, depending on the size of the body area involved.
                </p>   
                <br>
                <h3>What results should I expect?</h3>     
                <p>
                    A favourable, immediate end result of a laser treatment is skin that appears slightly or moderately pink (like a mild sunburn), with some pinpoint redness and inflammation also known as peri-follicular edema that disappears within 48 hours.  You may resume regular daily activities immediately following treatment, however, your skin must be protected from sun exposure or chemicals that can irritate the treatment site for approximately one week.  Using a high quality sunscreen (minimum SPF of 30) is recommended.  <br><br>
                    Over the next 2 weeks, you will notice that the old hair shafts will “extrude” or shed out of the follicle and a slowdown in hair growth will occur.  Since hair grows in cycles, laser treatments should be spaced about 4-6 weeks apart to inflict maximum damage to the next “batch” of hair growth for effective permanent hair reduction.
                </p> 
                <br>
                <h3>How many treatments will I need?</h3>   
                <p>
                    The number of treatments will of course, depend on the density of your hair, the colour of your hair, the colour of your skin (darker skin types will require more sessions), and the area of the body (some areas reduce more quickly than others).  Over the years, the laser hair removal industry have become familiar with the many factors that influence hair growth and hair reduction... therefore, the number of treatments will vary.  <br><br>
                    A personal consultation with our medical technician is required to give you a realistic estimate as to the length and cost of your procedure.   On average, 5 to 10 treatments are needed for a given area.  Fees range from $50 upwards.  We have seasonal specials and prepaid packages available throughout the year to help you save money, and have smooth, healthy skin.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Who cannot have laser hair removal?</h3>
                <p>As mentioned before, not everyone is a suitable candidate for laser hair removal.  Some contraindications are as follows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>ethnic Skin Type 6 (black African American skin)</li>
                        <li>have blond or white/gray hair</li>
                        <li>taking Accutane (for acne)</li>
                        <li>taking medications that are light-sensitizing (eg. Tetracycline)</li>
                        <li>have a “fresh” tan or have been recently exposed to sun</li>
                        <li>have excessive hair growth due to hormonal irregularity</li> 
                        <li>pregnancy<li>
                    </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Will I get new hairs over time?</h3>
                <p>
                	Yes.  We are living, breathing organisms that have the ability to heal and regenerate, and we change physiologically as we age.  Therefore, although laser hair removal aims for the permanent destruction of hair follicles, some will invariably repair and survive, and throughout our lifetime, hormonal influences will dictate the activation of new hair growth (or spontaneous destruction) of hair follicles. <br><br>
                    For that reason, we offer “maintenance” treatments at a reduced fee for certain body areas if needed (but not for all areas).  Please discuss this with your technician at consultation.
                </p>
