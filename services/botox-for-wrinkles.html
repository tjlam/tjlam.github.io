            <h3>What is Botox® Cosmetic?</h3>
            <p>BOTOX Cosmetic® is the only approved treatment to temporarily improve the appearance of moderate to severe frown lines between the brows and crow’s feet lines in adults. <br> <br>
            BOTOX Cosmetic® is one of the most extensively studied medical aesthetic treatments and is approved for cosmetic use in 78 countries. BOTOX Cosmetic® has a record of experience that aesthetic specialists know and trust. And, the safety and efficacy of BOTOX Cosmetic® have been evaluated in both Allergan sponsored clinical trials as well as in 417 peer-reviewed articles in scientific and medical journals.<br><br>
            BOTOX Cosmetic® contains tiny amounts of a highly purified botulinum toxin protein refined from the bacterium, Clostridium botulinum. Formulations, potency, and approved doses vary among botulinum toxin products, which means that one product cannot take the place of another. Those are a few reasons why there is no such thing as a “generic” form of BOTOX Cosmetic®. There have been no studies to support that other products are Unit-to-Unit equivalent to BOTOX Cosmetic®.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>How does Botox Costmetic® work?</h3>
            <p>BOTOX Cosmetic® targets one of the underlying causes of frown lines and crow’s feet—the repeated muscle contractions from frowning and squinting over the years. Your specialist will inject these muscles with BOTOX Cosmetic® to temporarily reduce muscle activity. You will begin to notice a visible smoothing of your crow’s feet lines and frown lines between your brows.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Does Botox Cosmetic® treatment hurt?</h3>
            <p>Some patients report that being injected with BOTOX Cosmetic® feels like a pinch. Your specialist may use ice to numb the treatment area. If you are concerned about discomfort, your specialist may apply a topical numbing cream before administering your treatment.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>What were common side effects seen in clinical studies?</h3>
            <p>Three percent of patients experienced eyelid drooping in the frown lines studies and 1% of patients experienced eyelid swelling in the crow's feet studies. Other possible side effects include: dry mouth; discomfort or pain at the injection site; tiredness; headache; neck pain; eye problems: double vision, blurred vision, decreased eyesight and dry eyes; and allergic reactions. These are not all of the possible serious side effects of BOTOX Cosmetic®. Please see the Important Safety Information including Boxed Warning and Medication Guide, and talk to your 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>How long does the treatment take?</h3>
            <p>Your specialist will discuss your treatment goals and perform a facial analysis to determine the appropriate treatments for you. The actual injection process takes about 10 minutes. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>What is the average treatment cost?</h3>
            <p>Your cost not only includes the price of the product, but more importantly, the skill and expertise of the specialist or healthcare professional who is administering your treatment. BOTOX Cosmetic® is a technique-sensitive treatment—look for someone who is licensed and trained and has experience treating patients with BOTOX Cosmetic®. Be wary of discount products or “cheap” BOTOX Cosmetic® —if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. <br> <br>
            It is more important to find an experienced specialist who will take the time to understand your treatment goals and develop a treatment plan that is right for you. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>When will I see results?</h3>
            <p>You may begin to notice results within 24 to 48 hours for moderate to severe frown lines, with results lasting up to 4 months</p>
            <br>
            <h3>How long is the recovery time after treatment?</h3>
            <p>After your treatment, you can resume your day. There is minimal downtime and your specialist may give you specific aftercare instructions.</p>
