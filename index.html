                            <p> JUVEDERM® is an injectable gel made of (non-animal) hyaluronic acid, a substance found naturally in the body. 

                            It is an excellent filler used for smoothing out fine lines, wrinkles and especially for lip enhancement. 

                            Since the product is non-allergenic, pretesting is not required. 

                            </br> </br> Results last from six to twelve months.

                            <p> Laser hair removal is a process that safely eliminates unwanted body hair by using various wavelengths of laser light that is selectively absorbed by the darker pigment in hair follicles. 

                            The latest technology uses Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) to deliver light energy into the follicle which is transformed into heat that destroys the hair bulb, leaving the surrounding skin unharmed. 

                            Cooling of the skin is done through the application of ice packs, cooling gels and sprays, making the procedure virtually painfree, without the need for expensive topical anaesthetic creams. </br>

                            Most treatments take only minutes to under an hour to administer, depending on the size of the body area. 

                            Your skin must be protected from sun exposure or chemicals that can irritate the treatment site for approximately one week. Therefore, a good sunscreen is recommended. 

                            The number of treatments will depend on the body part, the hair density and the type of skin you have. 

                            The results will speak for themselves - smooth, silky, stubble-free, healthy looking skin, free of infections, ingrown hairs, redness and hair "shadows".

                            <h3>Dr. Lily Lo</h3>
                            <p>Dr. Lily Lo graduated from the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Toronto, in 1990, where she is also a part-time clinical instructor. Since then, Dr. Lo is a general dentist and currently owns two dental practices- located in Toronto and Richmond Hill with a focus on Cosmetic Dentistry. As well, she has taken advanced education in the field of orthodontics, and thus, has successfully created beautiful smiles for children, teens and adults for over 20 years. Dr. Lo is also a certified provider of the Invisalign "braceless" system - a great alternative for adults who have mild to moderately malaligned teeth. In 2005, Dr. Lo opened the MD Laser Skin Clinic with her husband, Dr. Kenneth Lam. She was certified in 2007 to perform BOTOX COSMETIC® and injectable fillers under Dr. Lam's delegation. Dr. Lo is also a provider of BOTOX COSMETIC® Therapeutic which can be used for treatment of TMJD (Temporal Mandibular Joint Dysfunction) muscle hyperactivity and pain. "I have always been fascinated by the uniqueness and beauty of the human face. As a cosmetic dentist who has been shaping smiles for years using veneers, orthodontics, crowns and implants, I evaluate not only teeth, but all elements of facial anatomy including the lips, chin, cheeks, nose and forehead. I am thrilled to be able to perform procedures that not only give patients a fantastic smile, but also rejuvenate the skin for a natural, healthy, younger looking face!"</p>
