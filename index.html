Since then, Dr. Lo is a general dentist and currently owns two dental practices- located in Toronto and Richmond Hill with a focus on Cosmetic Dentistry. As well, she has taken advanced education in the field of orthodontics, and thus, has successfully created beautiful smiles for children, teens and adults for over 20 years.

"I have always been fascinated by the uniqueness and beauty of the human face. As a cosmetic dentist who has been shaping smiles for years using veneers, orthodontics, crowns and implants, I evaluate not only teeth, but all elements of facial anatomy including the lips, chin, cheeks, nose and forehead. I am thrilled to be able to perform procedures that not only give patients a fantastic smile, but also rejuvenate the skin for a natural, healthy, younger looking face!" </p>

                            <h3>Dr. Lily Lo</h3>
                            <p>Dr. Lily Lo graduated from the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Toronto, in 1990, where she is also a part-time clinical instructor. Since then, Dr. Lo is a general dentist and currently owns two dental practices- located in Toronto and Richmond Hill with a focus on Cosmetic Dentistry. As well, she has taken advanced education in the field of orthodontics, and thus, has successfully created beautiful smiles for children, teens and adults for over 20 years. Dr. Lo is also a certified provider of the Invisalign "braceless" system - a great alternative for adults who have mild to moderately malaligned teeth. In 2005, Dr. Lo opened the MD Laser Skin Clinic with her husband, Dr. Kenneth Lam. She was certified in 2007 to perform BOTOX COSMETIC® and injectable fillers under Dr. Lam's delegation. Dr. Lo is also a provider of BOTOX COSMETIC® Therapeutic which can be used for treatment of TMJD (Temporal Mandibular Joint Dysfunction) muscle hyperactivity and pain. "I have always been fascinated by the uniqueness and beauty of the human face. As a cosmetic dentist who has been shaping smiles for years using veneers, orthodontics, crowns and implants, I evaluate not only teeth, but all elements of facial anatomy including the lips, chin, cheeks, nose and forehead. I am thrilled to be able to perform procedures that not only give patients a fantastic smile, but also rejuvenate the skin for a natural, healthy, younger looking face!"</p>
