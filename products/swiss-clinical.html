				Developed by dermatologists, Swissclinical combines naturally sourced medical grade, bio-active ingredients in a skin care line that is proven to produce maximum effectiveness with purity and safety.  All of the skin care products are cosmeceutical formulas backed by research, and specially made with zero allergens, colourants, parabens, or other harmful substances and are 100% manufactured in Switzerland.  In respect for nature, all packaging is also made from recycled material and a share of sales is donated to the Aquaverde Association to replant the Amazonian rain forest.  These breathrough products should be used in conjunction with chemical peeling and micro-needling procedures to reverse damaged caused by sun, acne, and aging.
